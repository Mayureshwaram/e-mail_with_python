# e-mail_with_python
This contains various e-mail sending applications using python:
*   simple mail transfer
*   e-mail with attachment
*   sending e-mail to multiple receiver at a time.

## Note:
*Make sure that the path of **email_records.csv** file in **email_multipleRx.py** is proper.
OR,better way is to keep these two files in same directory.So, no need to give path instead give the complete name of .csv file in **email_multipleRx.py** application.*
